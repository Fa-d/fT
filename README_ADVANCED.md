## Architecture Highlights

### Event Sourcing
All state changes are captured as immutable events in SQLite:
```dart
// Example: User performs an action
final event = UserActionEvent(
  aggregateId: userId,
  action: 'login',
  timestamp: DateTime.now(),
);

await eventStore.appendEvent(event, aggregateType: 'User');
```

### CQRS Pattern
Separates read and write operations:
```dart
// Command (Write)
class CreatePostCommand extends Command {
  final String content;
  // ...
}

// Query (Read)
class GetPostsQuery extends Query<List<Post>> {
  final PaginationParams pagination;
  // ...
}
```

### Offline-First Sync
Automatic background synchronization with conflict resolution:
```dart
// Queue a change
syncManager.queueChange(userPost);

// Sync automatically runs in background
// Conflicts resolved using configured strategy
```
